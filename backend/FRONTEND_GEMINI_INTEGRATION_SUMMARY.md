**New Response Fields:**
```json
{
  "gemini_analysis": {
    "building_type_detected": "Residential apartment block (multi-story)",
    "architectural_features": ["Multi-story structure", "Precast concrete panels"],
    "construction_materials": ["Reinforced concrete", "Metal"],
    "age_estimate": "Late 20th Century (1960s-1980s)",
    "condition_assessment": "Catastrophic structural failure"
  },
  "cv_insights": {
    "height_insights": "Detailed height analysis explanation",
    "area_insights": "Detailed area analysis explanation",
    "reference_objects": ["External air conditioning units"],
    "limitations": ["Building base obscured by debris"]
  }
}
```

#### Cost Estimation Updates (`volume_based_cost_estimation.py`)
- ✅ Updated all cost calculations to use PKR (Pakistan Rupees)
- ✅ Converted base costs from USD to PKR (multiplied by ~280)

🤖 CV Model Analysis Report

Detailed Assessment
Height Analysis: The building exhibits approximately 9-10 visible floor levels...
Area Analysis: Estimating the footprint area is extremely challenging due to...

🏢 Building Type Detected:
Residential apartment block (multi-story)

🏗️ Architectural Features:
• Multi-story structure (approximately 9-10 floors)
• Precast concrete panel construction
• Balconies (largely destroyed but remnants visible)
• Window openings (glass/frames destroyed)

🧱 Construction Materials:
• Reinforced concrete (structural frame, floor slabs)
• Metal (rebar, destroyed window/balcony elements)
• Plaster/paint (exterior finishes)

📅 Age Estimate:
Late 20th Century (e.g., 1960s-1980s)

🔍 Condition Assessment:
Catastrophic structural failure, completely destroyed and irreparable

📏 Reference Objects:
• External air conditioning units on adjacent structure

⚠️ Analysis Limitations:
• Building base obscured by debris
• No clear reference objects for scale
• Camera angle prevents accurate footprint estimation
```

### Cost Display (PKR)
```
Total Estimated Cost: PKR 1,848,000
Cost Range: PKR 1,570,800 - PKR 2,125,200

Cost Breakdown:
• Structural Repairs: PKR 1.1L
• Non-Structural: PKR 0.6L  
• Contents & Equipment: PKR 0.3L
• Professional Fees: PKR 0.2L
```
